This is a semi-cumulative exam. 1 to 2 weekly portfolio assignments: Each week you will be given an assignment to test your understanding of key concepts and programming principles. Through these assignments you will build up an online portfolio of all your code from throughout the semester. 1 to 2 individual projects: Over the course of the semester you will begin working on individual-based analyses of unique biological datasets or problems. You will build up your analyses incrementally over the course of the semester by adapting code from your portfolio assignments to your individual datasets. 6.2 Secondary assessments Software checkpoints to assure that you have the proper software involved. These are usually completed by submitting a screen grab of your computer console showing successful installation of the software. Code checkpoints to assure that you can execute key functions correctly before attempting portfolio assignments. These are usually completed by submitting a screen grab of your computer console showing successful execution of the code. In-class TopHat polls, questions and small assignments. These are typically graded for participation. In-class Worksheets; you’ll usually complete these in-class and submit and image of them online via Canvas. These are typically graded for participation / completion. Other assignments: Other small assignments may be given for completion outside of class.

These assignments ARE required - “for participation” does NOT mean optional. 6.3 Pracice problems Occasionally, fully optional assignments worth 0 points will be released - these will be clearly marked as worth 0 points and for practice only. Canvas Quiz questions related to vocab, code, concepts etc. Optional Portfolio assignments Previous exam questions or full Practice tests. These questions may not always align perfectly with current course content but will give you an idea of the types of questions that will appear on an upcoming exam. 6.4 Test-taking policies Except for the first R quiz, tests will be in-person during the regularly schedule time and administered as Canvas Quiz. Components of exam typically include Stand-alone canvas quiz questions Code-based questions which you’ll answer via a separate file, submitted via Canvas.

Your lowest of the three regular unit exams will be dropped, e.g. if you miss an exam entirely due to illness. The final exam cannot be dropped. Make-up exams and exam re-takes will not be offered.

You may not communicate with other students while taking a test. 6.6 Test dropping policy Your lowest regular unit test will be dropped.
