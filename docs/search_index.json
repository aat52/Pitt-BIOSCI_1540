This is both the first course in the core sequence of classes of the Computational Biology major and also an elective for most Biological Sciences majors. This syllabus contains both key course policies and also is a repository for useful information about computational biology. The first several pages contain key information about the course. Subsequent pages are organized alphabetically by major topic. Pages marked “Appendix” are additional information about computational biology or research that you may find useful. Your first assignment in the class will be to read through the syllabus and complete a “Syllabus treasure hunt” assignment on Canvas. If you have a question about the syllabus (after you complete the syllabus treasure hunt) or even just spot a typo, post a comment on GitHub at https://github.com/brouwern/BIOSCI_1540 You’ll be shown how to add comments on GitHub in class.

If you are caught cheating on a graded assignment, you will receive a zero on the assignment. If you are caught cheating on an exam, you will receive a zero on the exam, an F in the course, and an Academic Integrity Violation Report will be filed. Below is the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity: “Students in this course are expected to comply with the University of Pittsburgh School of Arts &amp; Sciences Academic Integrity Code located at www.as.pitt.edu/faculty/policy/integrity.html. Any student suspected of failing to meet the student obligations of the code during the semester will be required to participate in the procedures for adjudication, initiated at the instructor level. This may include, but is not limited to, confiscation of the assignment of any individual suspected of violating the code. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the assignment will be imposed.

The final is the 5th unit test, but will also draw on themes from throughout the semester Other forms of assessment will include, 1. Test revisions (aka Test Reworks), which will count as a form of homework and do not add points back to your test. 1. Canvas Quiz questions related to lecture videos, Code checkpoints to assure that you can execute key functions, and Software checkpoints to assure that you have the proper software involved. 1. Additional homework 1. Practice tests or test preparation assignments. 7.1 Test-taking policies Tests will be in-person during the regularly schedule time and administered as a combination of Stand-alone canvas quiz questions Canvas quiz questions based on code I provide Code-based questions which you’ll answer via a separtate file, submitted via Canvas. 7.2 Key test policies All answers will be submitted by the end of the normal class period. If you are unable to take or complete an exam your score will be eligible to be dropped or replaced as specified elsewhere in the syllabus. It is your responsibility to assure that you have adequate power in your devices and internet access to complete exams. Adjustments will be made as necessary for students with DRS accommodations. You may not communicate with other students while taking a test. 7.3 Test dropping policy Your lowest unit test will be dropped. Your second-lowest score can be replaced by the final, if you score higher on the final. See the section on the final exam for further explanation. 7.4 Final Exam Policies The final will cover conceptual material covered after the Unit 4 test. You will also need to draw on R skills from throughout the semester. The final exam will … 1, Take place during finals week on the day scheduled by the University 1. Is required 1. Follow the general format of other tests. The final exam is required and will be scheduled as per the University calendar. As noted elsewhere your lowest test score will be automatically dropped and your score for tests calculated based on your 3 best tests. Additionally, I will compare your performance on the final to those three tests and if your score on the final is higher then I will upgrade that score to your score on the final. Your final eaxm can therefore contribute to you score in 2 ways - as the final, and as a replacement of your second lowest of the 4 unit tests. Therefore, one of your exams is always dropped, and a second one is potentially replaced. 7.5 Exam “buffer question” policy The unit tests and the final exam will have 1 to 2 “buffer points.” The way this work is that there will be, for example, 26 questions but the test will be worth a maximum of 25 points. The maximum score on the test will be capped at 25 points. If you miss 1 question you will get 25/25 points instead of 25/26. If you miss two questions you will get 24/25 and so forth. Scores greater than 100% will not be given.
