NOTE: If you have used R before that’s awesome! Please update your installation when the class begins - R goes through regular updates and works best with the newest version.

RStudio: www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download 14.1.3 Cloud-based R As a back-up to running R on your desktop I’ll also introduce you to RStudio Cloud. There are also several excellent primers which we’ll use.

You will need to “sync” your OneDrive account to your computer desktops to allow me to help you with your work. No code files will be shared via email or Canvas during the course.

GitHub: https://github.com/ 14.3 R packages Many R packages (aka libraries) will be used in this course. Below are several key ones. 14.3.1 swirl swirl is an R package that sets up interactive tutorials in your R console. It works both on desktop computers and RStudio cloud and is an excellent tool for learning and reviewing R. 14.3.2 Bioconductor Bioconductor is a clearing house and repository for high-grade bioinformatics and computational biology software using R.
