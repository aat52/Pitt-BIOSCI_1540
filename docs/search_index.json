This is both the first course in the core sequence of classes of the Computational Biology major and also an elective for most Biological Sciences majors. This syllabus contains both key course policies and also is a repository for useful information about computational biology. The first several pages contain key information about the course. Subsequent pages are organized alphabetically by major topic. Pages marked “Appendix” are additional information about computational biology or research that you may find useful. Your first assignment in the class will be to read through the syllabus and complete a “Syllabus treasure hunt” assignment on Canvas. If you have a question about the syllabus (after you complete the syllabus treasure hunt) or even just spot a typo, post a comment on GitHub at https://github.com/brouwern/BIOSCI_1540 You’ll be shown how to add comments on GitHub in class. The next page of the syllabus is a page for practicing adding comments.

Cheating includes any form of plagiarism, including copying other students’ work or using other resources without proper attribution. If you are caught cheating on a graded assignment, you will receive a zero on the assignment. If you are caught cheating on an exam, you will receive a zero on the exam, an F in the course, and an Academic Integrity Violation Report will be filed. Below is the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity: “Students in this course are expected to comply with the University of Pittsburgh School of Arts &amp; Sciences Academic Integrity Code located at www.as.pitt.edu/faculty/policy/integrity.html. Any student suspected of failing to meet the student obligations of the code during the semester will be required to participate in the procedures for adjudication, initiated at the instructor level. This may include, but is not limited to, confiscation of the assignment of any individual suspected of violating the code. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the assignment will be imposed.

This e-mail address may be used by the University for official communication. Students are expected to read e-mail sent to this account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with the content of the communications. The University provides an e-mail forwarding service that allows students to read their e-mail via other service providers. Students that choose to forward their e-mail from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If e-mail is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official communications sent to their University e-mail address. To forward e-mail sent to your University account, go to http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page.

Importantly, we’ll be taking a very novel approach to the textbook for this course: you will actually be building it yourself! Details will be provided in-class, but the gist regarding the textbook is: Most weeks you will be provided 1 or 2 chapters of the book in the form of computer files (“scripts”). For homework you will do exercises embedded in the chapters. When the exercises are successfully completed you will be able to convert the files to Web Pages and post them to your own Portfolio of book chapters and other completed activities.

NOTE: If you have used R before that’s awesome! However, Please update your installation when the class begins - R goes through regular updates and works best with the newest version. If you are having trouble installing R an excellent resource is: https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/introR.html REFERENCE R Core Team (2021).

You will need to “sync” your OneDrive account to your computer desktop to allow me to help you with your work. No code files will be shared via email or Canvas during the course. NOTE: If you do not have access to a computer you can sync your OneDrive account please contact me so we can workout a system. 12.2.2 GitHub Most code for this course will be available on GitHub and you will need to create an account for some activities. Links will be distributed directly to you, but you can also see key resources pinned to my profile at https://github.com/brouwern 12.3 R packages Many R packages (aka libraries) will be used in this course. Below are several key ones. 12.3.1 swirl swirl is an R package that sets up interactive tutorials in your R console. It works both on desktop computers and RStudio cloud and is an excellent tool for learning and reviewing R.
