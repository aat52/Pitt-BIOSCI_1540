\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\chapter{Academic integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

Dr.~Brouwer, the Bio Sci department, and the University all take academic integrity very seriously. Cheating includes any form of plagiarism, including copying other students' work or using other resources without proper attribution.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If you are caught cheating on a graded assignment, you will receive a zero on the assignment.
\item
  If you are caught cheating on an exam, you will receive a zero on the exam, an F in the course, and an Academic Integrity Violation Report will be filed.
\end{enumerate}

Below is the University's Policy on Academic Integrity:

\begin{quote}
``Students in this course are expected to comply with the University of Pittsburgh School of Arts \& Sciences Academic Integrity Code located at www.as.pitt.edu/faculty/policy/integrity.html. Any student suspected of failing to meet the student obligations of the code during the semester will be required to participate in the procedures for adjudication, initiated at the instructor level. This may include, but is not limited to, confiscation of the assignment of any individual suspected of violating the code. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the assignment will be imposed. Violation of the Academic Integrity Code requires the instructor to submit an Academic Integrity Violation Report to the Dean.''
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{assessments---homework-policies}{%
\chapter{Assessments - Homework policies}\label{assessments---homework-policies}}

Additional homework will be assigned via TopHat or Canvas. No late assignments will be accepted. Once an assignment closes on TopHat it will no longer be accepted. There will be no makeup homework assignments given. If you miss an assignment it will receive a zero. Your lowest 2 assignment scores will be dropped. This calculation will not be done until after finals.

\hypertarget{assessments}{%
\chapter{Assessments Overview}\label{assessments}}

The primary form of assessment in the course will be regular tests (5).

Other forms of assessment may include,
1. Test revisions (aka Test Reworks), which will count as a form of homework.\\
1. Quiz questions related to lecture videos, code checkpoints to assure that you can execute key functions, and software checkpoints to assure that you have the proper software involved.
1. Additional homework
1. Practice tests

\hypertarget{online-test-taking-policies}{%
\section{Online Test-taking policies}\label{online-test-taking-policies}}

Tests may be administered online.

\hypertarget{final-exam-policies}{%
\section{Final Exam Policies}\label{final-exam-policies}}

The final exam will \ldots{}
1, Take place during finals week on the day scheduled by the University
1. May be online or in person
1. Is required
1. Follow the general format of other tests.

\hypertarget{assessments-1}{%
\section{Assessments}\label{assessments-1}}

As noted previously, your lowest 2 test score will be dropped. Your next lowest test score can be replaced by your final exam, if your final exam score is higher. The final exam can therefore only benefit your score.

\hypertarget{communication---university-email-policy}{%
\chapter{Communication - University email policy}\label{communication---university-email-policy}}

Each student is issued a University e-mail address (username at pitt.edu). This e-mail address may be used by the University for official communication. Students are expected to read e-mail sent to this account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with the content of the communications.

The University provides an e-mail forwarding service that allows students to read their e-mail via other service providers. Students that choose to forward their e-mail from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If e-mail is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official communications sent to their University e-mail address.

To forward e-mail sent to your University account, go to \url{http://accounts.pitt.edu}, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your account when you have finished.

For the full E-mail Communication Policy, go to bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html.

\hypertarget{email_and_canvas_msg}{%
\chapter{Course communication - Email and Canvas Messages}\label{email_and_canvas_msg}}

Announcements to the whole course will occur typically on Friday afternoons. Other communcation related to course administration will also occur via Canvas message.

Your can message me on Canvas or email me at nlb24 at pitt.edu.

Please ``Comp Bio'' as the 1st thing in your email subject line with an informative bit of information as the ``\ldots{}''. Eg ``Comp Bio 2: problem accessing TopHat''.

If you use another email service as your primary email (eg GMail) please set your Pitt email to forward there.

For info on forwarding your Pitt email to your personal account follow this link: \url{https://bit.ly/2Riz7dx}

I try to answer all emails received on weekdays before 5 pm within 24-36 hrs. Emails recieved after 5 pm will be answered at the earliest the following morning. Emails received on the weekend will be answered Monday.

Please consult this syllabus before asking questions about course policies and the schedule, and refer to relevant information such as URLs, subject headings or dates. Screengrabs are super helpful. If the entire answer to your question can be found in the syllabus I will likely respond by saying ``This is in the syllabus, Cheers, Dr.~B.''*.

Questions relevant to the whole class may be reposted (with identifying details removed).

\begin{quote}
``This course is designed to give students a broad understanding of how computational approaches can be used to solve problems in biology. Both the biological and computational underpinnings of the methods will be addressed.''
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{course-materials-overview}{%
\chapter{Course materials overview}\label{course-materials-overview}}

Thanks to an Open Educational Resources (OER) grant from The Office of the Provost, there are no books to buy for this course - all course materials are free and will be provided digitally through Canvas.

Reading will take many forms: files containing computer code (scripts), articles and blog posts, as well as textbook. However, we'll be taking a very novel approach to the textbook for this course: \textbf{you will actually be building it yourself!}

Details will be provided in-class, but the gist regarding the textbook is:
1. Most weeks you will be provided 1 or 2 chapters of the book in the form of computer files (``scripts'').
1. For homework you will do exercises embedded in the chapters.
1. When the exercises are successfully completed you will be able to convert the files to Web Pages and post them to your own Portofolio of book chapters and other completed activites.

\hypertarget{course-materials---software}{%
\chapter{Course materials - Software}\label{course-materials---software}}

Installation and account creation for all software will be covered in detail during class or via assignmetns and accompanying videos. If you want to get prepared early for the course you can explore these on your own.

\textbf{Key Skills}:
1. Understanding R code\\
2. Data visualization\\
3. Graph interpretation\\
4. \ldots{}

Key to Computational Biology will be developing skills as a critical practioner and consumer of science. The course will heavily emphasize the application of skills related to scientific programming, including understanding and modifying R code, plotting data, organizing computational workflows, annotating computational projects. A central set of skill we be learnign to intepret the types of graphs used in computational biology, including alignments, phylogenies, networks, heatmaps, and ordination plots. The course will also introduce basic skills related to statistics, probablity, and mathematical modeling. We will also emphasize critical reading and interpretation of the primary literature.

I reserve the right to update the syllabus, schedule, point allocation and all other components of the course as necessary. If changes occur after the first day of class, they will be clearly communicated in class and via email, and a revised syllabus and schedule distributed. After reading the syllabus and completing the ``Syllabus treasure hunt'' assignment (which will be posted on the first day of class) feel free to contact me with any questions about course policies.
