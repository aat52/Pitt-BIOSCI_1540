\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

\textbf{This is the syllabus for BIOSCI 1540: Computational Biology.}

This is both the first course in the core sequence of classes of the Computational Biology major and also an elective for most Biological Sciences majors.

This syllabus contains both key course policies and also is a repository for useful information about computational biology.

The first several pages contain key information about the course. Subsequent pages are organized alphabetically by major topic.

Pages marked ``Appendix'' are additional information about computational biology or research that you may find useful.

Your first assignment in the class will be to read through the syllabus and complete a ``Syllabus treasure hunt'' assignment on Canvas.

If you have a question about the syllabus (after you complete the syllabus treasure hunt) or even just spot a typo, post a comment on \href{https://github.com/brouwern/BIOSCI_1540}{GitHub} at \url{https://github.com/brouwern/BIOSCI_1540}

You'll be shown how to add comments on GitHub in class. The next page of the syllabus is a page for practicing adding comments.

\hypertarget{github-comments-practice}{%
\chapter{Github comments practice}\label{github-comments-practice}}

Scroll down and locate the heading for the leter your last name begins with. Then locate the bullet point for theletter your first name begins with and add a comment to that line of code.

If you intials do not appear add a comment to the ``other'' label.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\chapter{Academic integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

Dr.~Brouwer, the Bio Sci department, and the University all take academic integrity very seriously. Cheating includes any form of plagiarism, including copying other students' work or using other resources without proper attribution.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If you are caught cheating on a graded assignment, you will receive a zero on the assignment.
\item
  If you are caught cheating on an exam, you will receive a zero on the exam, an F in the course, and an Academic Integrity Violation Report will be filed.
\end{enumerate}

Below is the University's Policy on Academic Integrity:

\begin{quote}
``Students in this course are expected to comply with the University of Pittsburgh School of Arts \& Sciences Academic Integrity Code located at www.as.pitt.edu/faculty/policy/integrity.html. Any student suspected of failing to meet the student obligations of the code during the semester will be required to participate in the procedures for adjudication, initiated at the instructor level. This may include, but is not limited to, confiscation of the assignment of any individual suspected of violating the code. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the assignment will be imposed. Violation of the Academic Integrity Code requires the instructor to submit an Academic Integrity Violation Report to the Dean.''
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{assessments}{%
\chapter{Assessments Overview}\label{assessments}}

The primary form of assessment in the course will be 5 unit tests.

The final is the 5th unit test, but will also draw on themes from throughout the semester

Other forms of assessment will include,\\
1. \textbf{Test revisions} (aka Test Reworks), which will count as a form of homework and do not add points back to your test.\\
1. \textbf{Canvas Quiz questions} related to lecture videos, \textbf{Code checkpoints} to assure that you can execute key functions, and \textbf{Software checkpoints} to assure that you have the proper software involved.
1. Additional homework
1. Practice tests or test preparation assignments.

\hypertarget{test-taking-policies}{%
\section{Test-taking policies}\label{test-taking-policies}}

Tests will be in-person during the regularly schedule time and administered as a combination of

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Stand-alone canvas quiz questions
\item
  Canvas quiz questions based on code I provide
\item
  Code-based questions which you'll answer via a separtate file, submitted via Canvas.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{key-test-policies}{%
\section{Key test policies}\label{key-test-policies}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  All answers will be submitted by the end of the normal class period.\\
\item
  If you are unable to take or complete an exam your score will be eligible to be dropped or replaced as specified elsewhere in the syllabus.
\item
  It is your responsibility to assure that you have adequate power in your devices and internet access to complete exams.\\
\item
  Adjustments will be made as necessary for students with DRS accommodations.
\item
  You may not communicate with other students while taking a test.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{test-dropping-policy}{%
\section{Test dropping policy}\label{test-dropping-policy}}

Your lowest unit test will be dropped. Your second-lowest score can be replaced by the final, if you score higher on the final. See the section on the final exam for further explanation.

\hypertarget{final-exam-policies}{%
\section{Final Exam Policies}\label{final-exam-policies}}

The final will cover conceptual material covered after the Unit 4 test. You will also need to draw on R skills from throughout the semester.

The final exam will \ldots{}
1, Take place during finals week on the day scheduled by the University
1. Is required
1. Follow the general format of other tests.

The final exam is required and will be scheduled as per the University calendar.

As noted elsewhere your lowest test score will be automatically dropped and your score for tests calculated based on your 3 best tests. Additionally, I will compare your performance on the final to those three tests and if your score on the final is higher then I will upgrade that score to your score on the final. Your final eaxm can therefore contribute to you score in 2 ways - as the final, and as a replacement of your second lowest of the 4 unit tests. Therefore, one of your exams is always dropped, and a second one is potentially replaced.

\hypertarget{exam-buffer-question-policy}{%
\section{Exam ``buffer question'' policy}\label{exam-buffer-question-policy}}

The unit tests and the final exam will have 1 to 2 ``buffer points.'' The way this work is that there will be, for example, 26 questions but the test will be worth a maximum of 25 points. The maximum score on the test will be capped at 25 points. If you miss 1 question you will get 25/25 points instead of 25/26. If you miss two questions you will get 24/25 and so forth. Scores greater than 100\% will not be given.

\hypertarget{homework}{%
\chapter{Assessments - Homework policies}\label{homework}}

Homework for outside of class will be assigned via Canvas.

\textbf{Late assignments:} Canvas will automatically deduct 0.5\% of your score on all non-test assignments per hour, rounding to the nearest hour (12\%/day). 29 minutes = 0 hours = full credit, 31 minutes = 1 hour.

\hypertarget{course-communication---overview}{%
\chapter{Course communication - Overview}\label{course-communication---overview}}

\hypertarget{primary-modes-of-communication}{%
\section{Primary modes of communication}\label{primary-modes-of-communication}}

All important details will be sent via Canvas messages and mentioned/discussed in class. It is your responsibility to regularly check Canvas messages to stay abreast of the course. Most communication will occur on Fridays, but important updates may be sent out at other times.

\hypertarget{secondary-modes-of-communication}{%
\section{Secondary modes of communication}\label{secondary-modes-of-communication}}

\hypertarget{github-issues}{%
\subsection{Github ``issues''}\label{github-issues}}

In this class we will be making extensive use of the code management site \href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}. Most communication about homework and other assignments will occur via GitHub's \href{https://guides.github.com/features/issues/}{Issues}{]} feature. In particular, to foster discussion we will use GitHub Issues to create forums around assignments and you will be required to submit comments.

\hypertarget{microsoft-sharepoint}{%
\subsection{Microsoft SharePoint}\label{microsoft-sharepoint}}

Files containing code for this course will be distributed using Microsoft Sharepoint. Sharepoint has messaging features which I may pilot test but will not rely on.

\hypertarget{email_and_canvas_msg}{%
\chapter{Course communication - Email and Canvas Messages}\label{email_and_canvas_msg}}

Announcements to the whole course via Canvas will occur typically on \textbf{Friday} afternoons. Other communication related to course administration will also occur via Canvas messages.

Your can message me on Canvas or email me at nlb24 at pitt.edu.

Please include ``Comp Bio'' as the 1st thing in your email subject line with an informative bit of information as the ``\ldots{}''. e.g.~``Comp Bio 2: problem accessing TopHat''. (Questions related to code are best submitted via GitHub).

If you use another email service as your primary email (eg GMail) please set your Pitt email to forward there.

For info on forwarding your Pitt email to your personal account follow this link: \url{https://bit.ly/2Riz7dx}

I try to answer all emails received on weekdays before 5 pm within 24-36 hrs. Emails received after 5 pm will be answered at the earliest the following morning. Emails received on the weekend will be answered Monday.

Please consult this syllabus before asking questions about course policies and the schedule, and refer to relevant information such as URLs, subject headings or dates. Screengrabs are super helpful. If the entire answer to your question can be found in the syllabus I will likely respond by saying ``\emph{This is in the syllabus, Cheers, Dr.~B.}''.

Questions relevant to the whole class may be reposted (with identifying details removed) to Canvas.

\hypertarget{communication---university-email-policy}{%
\chapter{Communication - University email policy}\label{communication---university-email-policy}}

Each student is issued a University e-mail address (username at pitt.edu). This e-mail address may be used by the University for official communication. Students are expected to read e-mail sent to this account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with the content of the communications.

The University provides an e-mail forwarding service that allows students to read their e-mail via other service providers. Students that choose to forward their e-mail from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If e-mail is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official communications sent to their University e-mail address.

To forward e-mail sent to your University account, go to \url{http://accounts.pitt.edu}, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your account when you have finished.

For the full E-mail Communication Policy, go to bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html.

\hypertarget{catalog-description}{%
\chapter{Catalog description}\label{catalog-description}}

The catalog description of this course is:

\begin{quote}
``This course is designed to give students a broad understanding of how computational approaches can be used to solve problems in biology. Both the biological and computational underpinnings of the methods will be addressed.''
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{course-materials-overview}{%
\chapter{Course materials overview}\label{course-materials-overview}}

Thanks to an Open Educational Resources (OER) grant from The Office of the Provost, there are no books to buy for this course - all course materials are free and will be provided digitally through Canvas.

Reading will take several forms:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  files containing computer code (scripts)
\item
  articles and blog posts,
\item
  textbook readings.
\end{enumerate}

Importantly, we'll be taking a very novel approach to the textbook for this course: \textbf{you will actually be building it yourself!}

Details will be provided in-class, but the gist regarding the textbook is:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Most weeks you will be provided 1 or 2 chapters of the book in the form of computer files (``scripts'').
\item
  For homework you will do exercises embedded in the chapters.
\item
  When the exercises are successfully completed you will be able to convert the files to Web Pages and post them to your own Portfolio of book chapters and other completed activities.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{course-materials---software}{%
\chapter{Course materials - Software}\label{course-materials---software}}

Installation and account creation for all software will be covered in detail during class or via assignments and accompanying videos. If you want to get prepared early for the course you can explore these on your own.
