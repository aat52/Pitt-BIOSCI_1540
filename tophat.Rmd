# TopHat

We will use TopHat in-class and for homework.  Please bring a charged TopHat compatible device to all lectures and recitations.  

<!-- See the **Course Policies** section for information related to if you are not able to answer TopHat questions during class due to technical difficulties.   -->

When logging into TopHat it will ask you for your university.  Typing in "University of Pittsburgh" often brings up multiple options: **select the one** that just says "University of Pittsburgh".
