## File names for homework

All files your create which get submitted for homework need to be in lower case and **strictly** adhere to this format:

> "pittemail_lastname_assignmenttitle"

For example:

"nlb24_brouwer_assign_1.rmd"

<!-- Any assignment submitted with an incorrect file name will recieve zero points and not be graded. If the file name is corrected the assignment will be graded but have 20% of the total points deducted. -->
