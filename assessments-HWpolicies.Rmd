# Assessments - Homework policies


Additional homework will be assigned via TopHat or Canvas.  No late assignments will be accepted.  Once an assignment closes on TopHat it will no longer be accepted.  There will be no makeup homework assignments given.  If you miss an assignment it will receive a zero.  Your lowest 2 assignment scores will be dropped.  This calculation will not be done until after finals.
