It is your responsibility to use your devices responsibly.  There is extensive evidence that hand writing notes is far more effective for learning than typing notes (Mueller & Oppenheimer 2014, Cepeda et al 2014).  If you device use is disruptive to the class you will recieve a warning.  A 2nd violation will result in the loss of TopHat points for the class.  If a 3rd violation occurs no longer permitted to use a device in class and you will recieve a zero for all remaining in-class TopHat points since you will no longer be able to use a device in-class.

## Computers in class

If possible Iâ€™d like everyone to bring a laptop on the first day of class loaded with the software for the class.  If access to a laptop is in any way a problem, let me know so we can chat.  Also, if you have any problems loading the software listed below let me know.


# Types of assignments

## Tests

### Midterm exam

There will be XXX midterm exams.

### Final exam

There will be a full length final exam held at the schedule time.  If you have scheduling conflicts please contact the registrar.

## Class participation

### In-class worksheets 

Occassionaly you will be asked to complete a short worksheet or draw an example of a diagram in-class related to a lecture or discussion. These will be collected and graded for participation similar to TopHat participation questions.

### TopHat participation questions

I will regularly use TopHat to ask short questions (eg, multiple choice) to assess your understanding or survey the class.  To account for malfunctioning devices etc you will recieve full credit if you answer at least 75% of the question for a session.  Additionally, you will be able to drop you two lowest TopHat participation scores, for example if you are absent.

### Forced participation questions

During lectures and discussions I will randomly select students to answer my question or engage in a conversation with me.  Selection will be random, without replacement, until everyone has participated, then will begin again. If you are not present I will skip you.  If you are present we will engage in a discussion, and you are free to say "I don't know" to any question I ask.  I will then follow up. You will not be graded on the quality of your response, but rather on your participation and willingness to engage in discussion.  I assume everyone will get full credit on this.

## Software check points (SCPs)

We will use several types of software during this class and it is imperative that you have downloaded, installed, and checked the software prior to classes or the beginning of assignments.  To make sure this happens you will generally be required to submit a selfie of yourself in front of your computer with the software open.  These files will be submitted, with the correct file name, to a designated shared folder.
